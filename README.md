# ABSTRACT
Prior research has examined segmentations of end-user populations by their information-security-related mental models, perceptions, and security-related intentions. Different categories of individuals have notable differences in technical background and privacy preferences. Rule lists and tip sheets are often deployed by organizations to enlist the help of the end-user to improve computer security. In this study, a group of 25 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers responded questions about their information-security-related intentions, then read a tip sheet about information privacy from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, (CISA) then answered questions about their willingness to spend resources on following the recommendations from the tip sheet. This study finds that not all subjects are willing to spend money, time, or effort to follow the rules in the tip sheet. This study also finds that subjects that had higher scores on a security intentions scale were willing to spend a significantly different amount of effort following the recommendations on the tip sheet in some, but not all scenarios. The study concludes with recommendations based on these findings.
